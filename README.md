# Release/Dev Enforcer Rule

The `releasedev-enforcer-rule` is a [(custom) enforcer rule]
(https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-api/writing-a-custom-rule.html) to check that at least one of the profiles
`release` and `dev` is activated.

[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24855678/enforce-exactly-one-of-two-maven-profiles) is a discussion related to
the origin of this enforcer rule.

Here is a usage example of this enforcer rule:

    <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <id>enforce-contour-war</id>
                <goals>
                    <goal>enforce</goal>
                </goals>
                <configuration>
                    <rules>
                        <releaseDevEnforcerRule implementation="com.jamasoftware.maven.enforcer.releasedev.ReleaseDevEnforcerRule" />
                    </rules>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.jamasoftware.maven.enforcer</groupId>
                <artifactId>releasedev-enforcer-rule</artifactId>
                <version>...version...</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </plugin>

For example, given the following command-line: `mvn ... -Prelease,dev`, you may expect the following output:

    [main] [INFO] --- maven-enforcer-plugin:...version...:enforce (...) @ ... ---
    [main] [WARNING] Rule 1: com.jamasoftware.maven.enforcer.releasedev.ReleaseDevEnforcerRule failed with message:
    Module requires profile "release" XOR "dev"; "release" profile activated; "dev" profile activated
    ...
    [main] [INFO] BUILD FAILURE
    ...
